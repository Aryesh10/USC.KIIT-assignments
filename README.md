1. **Download Project Files:**

   - Download the project files from the provided Google Drive link.
   - Ensure you have the following files:
     - `Diabetes Classifier.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook)
     - The machine learning model file
     - The dataset file

2. **Place Files in a Directory:**

   - Create a new directory on your computer and place all the downloaded files into it.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
